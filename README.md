# Algorithm-Visualiser
Different Types of path finding algorithms are visualised using pygame library

# DFS (Depth First Search)

* Depth-first search (DFS) is an algorithm for searching a graph or tree data structure. The algorithm starts at the source node of a tree and goes as far as it can down a given branch (path), then backtracks until it finds an unexplored path, and then explores it. The algorithm does this until the desination node is reached *

## Game Features
    * Select source in the grid
    * Select destination in the grid
    * Select obstacles in the grid
    * Click to begin the visulaisation

## Here are the few screenshots of the dfs visulaisation

# Step 1: Select Source
   
# Step 2: Select Destination
